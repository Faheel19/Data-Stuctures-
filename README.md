# Data-Stuctures

# Binary Search Tree.cpp
A data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.

# Binary Tree 2.0.cpp
Faster Version

# Expression Tree.cpp
A representation of expressions arranged in a tree-like data structure. In other words, it is a tree with leaves as operands of the expression and nodes contain the operators. Similar to other data structures, data interaction is also possible in an expression tree

# FG.cpp

# Linked_List.cpp
The most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node

# MST.cpp
A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of edges of a connected weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight.

# Queue Simulation.cpp
A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end

# double linked list adt.cpp
A linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.

# recursiveLinkL.cpp
A recursive data structure is a data structure that is partially composed of smaller or simpler instances of the same data structure. For example, linked lists and binary trees can be viewed as recursive data structures.

# stackPalindrome
A linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure, that is top. In this program we find a palindrome using the stack data structure
